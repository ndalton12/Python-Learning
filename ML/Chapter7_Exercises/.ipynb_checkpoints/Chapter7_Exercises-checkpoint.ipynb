    "Load the MNIST data (introduced in Chapter 3), and split it into a training set, a validation set, and a test set (e.g., use the first 40,000 instances for training, the next 10,000 for validation, and the last 10,000 for testing). Then train various classifiers, such as a Random Forest classifier, an Extra-Trees classifier, and an SVM. Next, try to combine them into an ensemble that outperforms them all on the validation set, using a soft or hard voting classifier. Once you have found one, try it on the test set. How much better does it perform compared to the individual classifiers?"
