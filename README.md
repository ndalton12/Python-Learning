# Python-Learning
A repo for learning Python as a part of my Senior Independent Study Project (SISP) for Mass Academy.

## Progress

* Finished problem sets from Think Python book [3]

* Did some of the new-coder tutorials [2] 

* Worked extensively through problem sets in Hands-On ML book [1]

## Next Goals

### In progress

* Finish all problem sets from Hands-on ML book

* Commit to an open source project

* Try to get project on computing cluster, get involved with research based in Python

### Afterwards

* Learn about Python web-dev (i.e. django/flask)

* Learn TF-Serving

* Final project(?): Complete ML application with web app with Python backend to serve functionality to users

Snippets from [1] are used in the ML folder exercises and most work in the ML folder features work combined with or derivative of examples from [1].

Code from [2] is used in the newcoderio folder, modified for use with Python 3. 

Snippets from [3] are used sparingly in the ThinkPython folder, with direct examples labeled with a 'From book' comment (book refers to [3]) . Code sections not labeled with that comment are original, but may be inspired by previous examples from the book.
