# Python-Learning
A repo for learning Python as a part of my Senior Independent Study Project (SISP) for Mass Academy.

## Progress

* Finished problem sets from Think Python book [3] :heavy_check_mark:

* Did some of the new-coder tutorials [2] :heavy_check_mark:

* Commit to an open source project :heavy_check_mark:

* Finish all problem sets from Hands-on ML book [1] (may return to expand on some problems) :heavy_check_mark:

* Competed in a Kaggle competition :heavy_check_mark:

* Finished a course (MITx 6.00.2x) on data science :heavy_check_mark:

* Created a [website](https://github.com/ndalton12/shifting-morals) using Django :heavy_check_mark:

## Future Extensions

* Algorithmic trading + financial data science project

* Learn GANs, PyTorch, TF-Serving, other cool new ML stuff + ML project

* Contribute more to open source

* Expand statistical knowledge using Python examples

**<hr>**

Snippets from [1] are used in the ML folder exercises and most work in the ML folder features work combined with or derivative of examples from [1].

Code from [2] is used in the newcoderio folder, modified for use with Python 3. 

Snippets from [3] are used sparingly in the ThinkPython folder, with direct examples labeled with a 'From book' comment (book refers to [3]) . Code sections not labeled with that comment are original, but may be inspired by previous examples from the book.
