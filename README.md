Snippets from [1] are used in the ML folder exercises and most work in the ML folder features work combined with or derivative of examples from the book.

Snippets from [2] are used sparingly in the ThinkPython folder, with direct examples labeled with a 'From book' comment. Code sections not labeled with such comments are original work.
