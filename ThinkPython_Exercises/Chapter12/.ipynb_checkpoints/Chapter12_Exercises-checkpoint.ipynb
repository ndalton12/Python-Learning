    "2. Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can\n",
    "consider the empty string reducible.\n",
    "3. The wordlist I provided, words.txt, doesn’t contain single letter words. So you might want\n",
    "to add “I”, “a”, and the empty string.\n",
    "4. To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are\n",
